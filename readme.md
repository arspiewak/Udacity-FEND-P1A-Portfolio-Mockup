# FEND-P1A-Portfolio-Mockup  Mockup version of Portfolio project

Odd notes:
- The first phase of this project is matching the assigned mockup. I have saved that
  state of my project with branch name "mockup".
- The images used in the mockup phase were obtained by exporting JPG images from the
  design PDF provided by the instructors. Used courtesy of Udacity.
- Work has continued to complete the project in another github repository,
  Udacity-FEND-P1-Portfolio. This repository "freezes" the code at the "mockup"
  stage.
- Note that the commit history required to get to this state is stored in the
  continuing (P1) repository, which was copied without history.
